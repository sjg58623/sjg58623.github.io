<h2> The City that Never Sleeps</h2>
<p> Athens officially became a town in 1806. It was built around the preexisting University of Georgia which was founded in 1785. As the size of the university grew, Athens grew with it. However the basic structure of the city has stayed the same. To this day, the success of the city is heavily dependent on UGA and its students and staff. Despite all the greatness associated with this city, there is still immense poverty throughout the area. As seen in the above table, the poverty is still increasing in this area. Looking past this the city of Athens has a lot to offer. In the historic downtown of Athens, Ga there is something to do for everyone.From ages 1-100, anyone who comes to this great city finds something to love. </p>

<h3>My Favorite Part of Athens</h3>
<p> I love lots of things about Athens but my favorite part is without a doubt, football gamedays. The entire campus is always buzzing with excitement right when you wake up and everyone is having a great time. It is a time to kick back, grill some burgers, and have a beer while hanging out with friends or family. Nothing productive happens in Athens on a fall Saturday and that is the beauty of it. Every person you come across on a gameday is so kind and generous which adds to the fun environment. No matter your age, gender, race, or social status everyone comes together at Sanford Stadium to cheer for the Dawgs. It is truly a one of a kind atmosphere that I encourage everyone to experience at least once in their life.</p>
<h4> University of Georgia</h4> 
<p> You cannot talk about the city of Athens without bringing up the University of Georgia. With over 36,000 enrolled students and five 1,000+ capacity dining halls it is safe to say it is a very large University. It contains 17 different colleges within it and over 210 majors to choose from. Most of the stores, restaurants, and bars thrive because of money they receive from UGA students. There is no place I would rather live than Athens are there is without a doubt no place I would rather go to school than UGA. GO DAWGS!</p>
